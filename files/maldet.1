.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux Malware Detect is a malware scanner for Linux released under the GNU GPLv2 license, that is designed around the threats faced in shared hosted environments. It uses threat data from network edge intrusion detection systems to extract malware that is actively being used in attacks and generates signatures for detection. In addition, threat data is also derived from user submissions with the LMD checkout feature and from malware community resources. The signatures that LMD uses are MD5 file hashes and HEX pattern matches, they are also easily exported to any number of detection tools such as ClamAV.
.PP
The driving force behind LMD is that there is currently limited availability of open source/restriction free tools for Linux systems that focus on malware detection and more important that get it right. Many of the AV products that perform malware detection on Linux have a very poor track record of detecting threats, especially those targeted at shared hosted environments.
.PP
The threat landscape in shared hosted environments is unique from that of the standard AV products detection suite in that they are detecting primarily OS level trojans, rootkits and traditional file-infecting viruses but missing the ever increasing variety of malware on the user account level which serves as an attack platform.

.SH THREAT SOURCE DATA
The defining difference with LMD is that it doesn't just detect malware based 
on signatures/hashes that someone else generated but rather it is an 
encompassing project that actively tracks in the wild threats and generates 
signatures based on those real world threats that are currently circulating.
.PP
There are four main sources for malware data that is used to generate LMD 
signatures:
.IP \(bu 3
Network Edge IPS: The network I manage hosts over 35,000 web sites and as
such receives a large amount of daily abuse, all of which is logged by our 
network edge IPS. The IPS events are processed to extract malware url's, 
decode POST payload and base64/gzip encoded abuse data and ultimately that 
malware is retrieved, reviewed, classified and then signatures generated as 
appropriate. The vast majority of LMD signatures have been derived from IPS 
extracted data.
.IP \(bu 3
Community Data: Data is aggregated from multiple community malware websites
such as clean-mx and malwaredomainlist then processed to retrieve new 
malware, review, classify and then generate signatures.
.IP \(bu 3
ClamAV: The HEX & MD5 detection signatures from ClamAV are monitored for
relevant updates that apply to the target user group of LMD and added to the 
project as appropriate. To date there has been roughly 400 signatures ported 
from ClamAV while the LMD project has contributed back to ClamAV by 
submitting over 1,100 signatures and continues to do so on an ongoing basis.
.IP \(bu 3
User Submission: LMD has a checkout feature that allows users to submit
suspected malware for review, this has grown into a very popular feature and 
generates on average about 30-50 submissions per week.
.SH SIGNATURE UPDATES
The LMD signatures are updated typically once per day or more frequently
depending on incoming threat data from the LMD checkout feature, IPS malware
extraction and other sources. The updating of signatures in LMD installations
is performed daily through the default cron.daily script with the \fB--update\fP
option, which can be run manually at any time.
