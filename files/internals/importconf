# hash signature file.
# [ changing this may have an impact on scan performance ]

# [ changing this may have an impact on scan performance ]
scan_hexdepth="65536"

# Use named pipe (FIFO) for passing file contents hex data instead of stdin

# If installed, use ClamAV clamscan binary as default scan engine which

# Allows non-root users to perform scans. This must be enabled when

scan_ignore_root="$scan_ignore_root"

# This allows for specific user or groups to be ignored entirely from scan
# file lists. This option should be used with care and is not ideal for

# The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the 'find' file list generation
# will run before it is terminated. All 'find' results up to the point of
# termination will be fully scanned. If performing a full scan of all user paths
# on a large server, it is reasonable to expect the find operation may take a
# long time to complete and as such this feature may interfere. In such cases,
# this feature can be disabled/modified on a per-scan basis using the
# '-co|--config-option' CLI option, such as:
# "maldet -co scan_find_timeout=0 -a /home/?/public_html".

# The daily cron 'find' operation performed by LMD detects recently created/modifed

# be desirable to persist the file list results so that other applications/tasks
# may make use of the results. When scan_export_filelist is set enabled, the most

# [ STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ]
# This is a beta feature and as such should be used with caution.
# Currently, this feature can have a substantially negative impact
# on scan performance, especially with large file sets.
##
# The string length test is used to identify threats based on the
# length of the longest uninterrupted string within a file. This is
# useful as obfuscated code is often stored using encoding methods
# that produce very long strings without spaces (e.g: base64)
# [ string length in characters, default = 150000 ]
