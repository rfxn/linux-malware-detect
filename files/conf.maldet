# Allow non-root users to perform malware scans. This must be
# enabled when using mod_security2 upload scanning or if you
# want to allow users to perform scans. When enabled, this will
# populate the /usr/local/maldetect/pub/ path with user owned
# quarantine, session and temporary paths to faciliate scans.

# /etc/cron.d/maldet_pub cronjob.

##
# [ STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ]
##
# The string length test is used to identify threats based on the
# length of the longest uninterrupted string within a file. This is
# useful as obfuscated code is often stored using encoding methods
# that produce very long strings without spaces (e.g: base64)
# [ string length in characters, default = 150000 ]

# that have been created/modified/moved

# This is the html/web root for users relative to homedir, when
# this option is set, users will only have the webdir monitored
